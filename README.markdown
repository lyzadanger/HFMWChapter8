The directories here that begin with numerals represent subsequent steps as the learner moves through the chapter exercises.

#### How to Use: Chapter ZIP file or `chapter8` directory on <http://hf-mw.com> (normal mode)
Everything you need for completing the exercises in the chapter is contained in the `chapter8.zip` file, which is an archive of the `chapter8` directory.

#### How to Use: Build from repo source (expert mode)
Execute the `build.sh` script; it will spit out a `chapter8` directory and also a ZIP archive of same. This is the starting point for the exercises in the chapter. You can then use `chapter8` exclusively and ignore everything else.
